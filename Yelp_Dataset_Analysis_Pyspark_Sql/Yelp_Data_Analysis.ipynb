SOOO much better than waiting 4 hours to eat this! \n\nI have to admit, Franklin BBQ is still the best I've had despite having 7 years to trying other BBQ.

Therefore, when we booked our trip to Austin Franklin BBQ was an absolute must. I've had plenty of Texas bbq throughout the years living in central Texas for a bit. Texas BBQ is my favorite style of bbq and I've felt like I've already had the very best of it. Welp, that's until I went to Franklin. We ordered curbside pickup the prior week and chose the 12-12:30 window to pick up out food. Right now the dining room is closed due to covid so thankfully we ordered in advance and did not decide to just show up and stand in line. We arrived and checked in with the attendant and she directed us to a spot in the parking lot to wait for our food. This place had smoke rolling and the smells were giving us hope that this would be a legit experience. Our food came out about 10 minutes after we arrived. We ordered the brisket, turkey, smoked sausage, Cole slaw, potato salad, beans, and some pecan pies. Since the dining room was closed we brought the food back to our hotel and ate it in the lobby. I can only imagine how jealous the guests were as we devoured our food. The meal came with 2 different bbq sauces and one of them almost had a coffee roasted flavor to it. It was awesome. The meats were wrapped in the signature Franklin BBQ pink butchers paper and the juices were soaking right through the paper. There was not a lack of juicy meat in this order. I made a plate of everything I ordered. I started with the brisket and don't ever recall eating a better brisket. It was juicy, tender, had the perfect amount of rub, and smoked to perfection. I've smoked a few briskets myself and I've never achieved this level of perfection. You can tell why this place is so popular. I followed the brisket with the turkey and smoked sausage and am in awe of how the turkey can stay so damn juicy. How does that even happen. If I was a turkey I'd sacrifice myself at the steps of this bbq place just to be served. Finally to the sides, they were good but nothing can take attention away from the smoked meats. Back to the brisket, the crazy thing about this brisket is how it had a perfect balance to it yet it let the meat speak for itself. I used a bit of bbq sauce just to try it but you really don't need the sauce for any of these meats. Love it from start to finish. I can't think of better bbq anywhere and if you see my profile, you can see this body is shaped by bbq. It's a passion of mine.",2],["Franklin Barbecue","2021-01-20","We have done the line and every other year we order a vacuum packed brisket for Thanksgiving or Christmas. They are simply the best. We also made several life-long friends while waiting in that line.

Luckily a friend told me he tried to go the week before but couldn't cus they were sold out and warned me to order ahead. Good thing is, with covid, you can just place an order online and do curbside pickup which means no 3 hour wait! Bad news is, there's a 3lbs minimum and it was just two of us. \n\nOrdered 1lbs each of the ribs, brisket and pulled pork. Also ordered 1 sausage, 1 sandwich and 1 potato salad. I had such high hopes but I was underwhelmed. The brisket was good but so much oil it was sogging up all the wrapping paper. The food was overall overly salty. It tastes fine but nothing out of this world that would make me come back. Maybe a place I'd recommend trying once in your life but it's only one time for me. \n\nCurbside was fast and easy so nows a good time to try it. They don't include any utensils or napkins or wet naps so we had to go get done once we realized. \n\nFor over $100, I expected to like it but it didn't meet my expectations.

Are amazing. They're a little on the small side, but they are cleaned to perfection and tasted so good.  I had various flavors locally. They are a must get. \n\nLobster roll totally changed my views on lobster rolls. Its expensive, but worth every penny...ALMOST. why the 4 star review and almost worth every penny ? I'll tell ya why.  They butter their lobster meat and roll so much that the bread/roll actually turns to moosh. They roll basically melts. This was very messy to eat as there is an abundance of fresh, hot lobster meat on top. If they can just melt a little less butter, id have to say this might be the best lobster roll I've ever had.

This time orders are taken all online at least a week ahead and you just go on your time slot to pick up the food! SOOO much better than waiting 4 hours to eat this! \n\nI have to admit, Franklin BBQ is still the best I've had despite having 7 years to trying other BBQ. However due to not being a BBQ fan, I wouldn't have waited 4 hours again! Luckily the pandemic actually made eating this easier!\n\nThe brisket is still so tender but I enjoyed the turkey more this time! My daughter could not stop eating the turkey too! \n\nThe beet ice cream at the end was awesome! \n\nThank you Franklin for making delicious BBQ!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Franklin Barbecue</td><td>2021-01-23</td><td>Living in Denver we only have a few legit Texas bbq joints. Therefore, when we booked our trip to Austin Franklin BBQ was an absolute must. I've had plenty of Texas bbq throughout the years living in central Texas for a bit. Texas BBQ is my favorite style of bbq and I've felt like I've already had the very best of it. Welp, that's until I went to Franklin. We ordered curbside pickup the prior week and chose the 12-12:30 window to pick up out food. Right now the dining room is closed due to covid so thankfully we ordered in advance and did not decide to just show up and stand in line. We arrived and checked in with the attendant and she directed us to a spot in the parking lot to wait for our food. This place had smoke rolling and the smells were giving us hope that this would be a legit experience. Our food came out about 10 minutes after we arrived. We ordered the brisket, turkey, smoked sausage, Cole slaw, potato salad, beans, and some pecan pies. Since the dining room was closed we brought the food back to our hotel and ate it in the lobby. I can only imagine how jealous the guests were as we devoured our food. The meal came with 2 different bbq sauces and one of them almost had a coffee roasted flavor to it. It was awesome. The meats were wrapped in the signature Franklin BBQ pink butchers paper and the juices were soaking right through the paper. There was not a lack of juicy meat in this order. I made a plate of everything I ordered. I started with the brisket and don't ever recall eating a better brisket. It was juicy, tender, had the perfect amount of rub, and smoked to perfection. I've smoked a few briskets myself and I've never achieved this level of perfection. You can tell why this place is so popular. I followed the brisket with the turkey and smoked sausage and am in awe of how the turkey can stay so damn juicy. How does that even happen. If I was a turkey I'd sacrifice myself at the steps of this bbq place just to be served. Finally to the sides, they were good but nothing can take attention away from the smoked meats. Back to the brisket, the crazy thing about this brisket is how it had a perfect balance to it yet it let the meat speak for itself. I used a bit of bbq sauce just to try it but you really don't need the sauce for any of these meats. Love it from start to finish. I can't think of better bbq anywhere and if you see my profile, you can see this body is shaped by bbq. It's a passion of mine.</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Franklin Barbecue</td><td>2021-01-20</td><td>We have done the line and every other year we order a vacuum packed brisket for Thanksgiving or Christmas. They are simply the best. We also made several life-long friends while waiting in that line. It is an experience you need to have at least once.</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Franklin Barbecue</td><td>2021-01-20</td><td>Heard this was THE place to go in all of the US for bbq so I was excited! Luckily a friend told me he tried to go the week before but couldn't cus they were sold out and warned me to order ahead. Good thing is, with covid, you can just place an order online and do curbside pickup which means no 3 hour wait! Bad news is, there's a 3lbs minimum and it was just two of us. \n\nOrdered 1lbs each of the ribs, brisket and pulled pork. Also ordered 1 sausage, 1 sandwich and 1 potato salad. I had such high hopes but I was underwhelmed. The brisket was good but so much oil it was sogging up all the wrapping paper. The food was overall overly salty. It tastes fine but nothing out of this world that would make me come back. Maybe a place I'd recommend trying once in your life but it's only one time for me. \n\nCurbside was fast and easy so nows a good time to try it. They don't include any utensils or napkins or wet naps so we had to go get done once we realized. \n\nFor over $100, I expected to like it but it didn't meet my expectations. I've had much better bbq elsewhere like Phil's in San Diego.</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Franklin Barbecue</td><td>2021-01-20</td><td>We have been comparing Texas BBQ and trying different places when we make a trip down. Franklin's was worth the wait! The brisket was so tender and amazing I would totally get it again! I also really enjoyed the side of beans. They did not include paper plates or forks so we were thankful we stopped to get drinks and the waitress there hooked us up. \nThe turkey was a little dry but the brisket made up for that.</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Neptune Oyster</td><td>2021-01-23</td><td>To die for!  Saturday lunch. Great staff, very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. Oysters on the half, Neptune Pearls and Eros divine. Tried the sea urchin - yummy. Then the lobstah rolls.

Are amazing. They're a little on the small side, but they are cleaned to perfection and tasted so good.  I had various flavors locally. They are a must get. \n\nLobster roll totally changed my views on lobster rolls. Its expensive, but worth every penny...ALMOST. why the 4 star review and almost worth every penny ? I'll tell ya why.  They butter their lobster meat and roll so much that the bread/roll actually turns to moosh. They roll basically melts. This was very messy to eat as there is an abundance of fresh, hot lobster meat on top. If they can just melt a little less butter, id have to say this might be the best lobster roll I've ever had.  The roll is overdosed with fresh lobster meat and thats it. No fillers and no extras. The lobster is the true star of the show. \n\n2 hour wait?

It was easy to find and had lots of parking spaces.  There was a social distancing line to get in and be seated.  An outdoor host made the wait pleasant with sharing the menu and telling us about the specials of the day and what may have sold out.  There was outdoor music to listen to as well.  Once we were brought inside, you ordered and paid at the counter similar to what Jason's Deli or Panera does. Then you find your own seat with your order number on display for the food servers to find you. There's a separate beverage area with peppers that bring your drinks to your table. If you want to purchase any baked goods you go to the bakery counter and choose and pay there.  They wrap up your purchases in take out containers.  The servers bring your food order to your table.  The staff on our visit were very pleasant and accommodating as were the order takers at the registers.  The interior is clean, a bit crowded at peak times, not too noisy with long picnic tables and benches or small tables for two. I ordered the ciabatta breakfast sandwich with a fried green tomato, a fried egg, pimiento cheese spread and home made sausage. It was a huge portion so I took half home.  It's really best to share since even my husbands sausage gravy over Biscuits was a very large portion.  The coffee was very good as was the medium pulpy orange juice.  My ciabatta sandwich was very good.  The crunchy fried green tomato made the sandwich almost perfect.  In the future I'd get the pimiento spread on the side.  It tends to overshadow the flavors of the other items.  My husband was very happy with his biscuits and sausage gravy.  It had a bit of peppery flavor and was creamy.  Those biscuits are really good but very heavy...true \"sinkers\" that fill you up fast.\nWe ordered some bakery items to take home with us.  The salted caramel dark chocolate mini pecan pie had a wonderful buttery crust.  But I warn you, the filling is so rich we each could only eat 1/4 of a mini sized pie.  We also ordered salted caramel chocolate brownie cakes. Huge round portions that turned you into a diabetic just looking at them.  They were moist and chocolatey and VERY dense but just too sweet! We each had 1 bite.  This restaurant is worth a visit.  Just be prepared to share share share!  You'll need lots of coffee to get past the heavy sweetness in the baked goods.",2],["Se7en Bites","2021-01-23","We decided to try Se7en Bites . We got a mixture of breakfast items.

Luckily you can leave your number and be back later. One of the best burgers of my life, and wasn't even meat. Their King Deluxe is smothered in a chipotle-pecan aioli pesto and it's cooked amazingly. Awesome lemonade and teas, and the chips and salsa was fire. I tell everyone I can to get there the second you can because it's worth it. They've got cool music and the ambience is amazing. They've also got board games while waiting and a very polite staff.

It was easy to find and had lots of parking spaces.  There was a social distancing line to get in and be seated.  An outdoor host made the wait pleasant with sharing the menu and telling us about the specials of the day and what may have sold out.  There was outdoor music to listen to as well.  Once we were brought inside, you ordered and paid at the counter similar to what Jason's Deli or Panera does. Then you find your own seat with your order number on display for the food servers to find you. There's a separate beverage area with peppers that bring your drinks to your table. If you want to purchase any baked goods you go to the bakery counter and choose and pay there.  They wrap up your purchases in take out containers.  The servers bring your food order to your table.  The staff on our visit were very pleasant and accommodating as were the order takers at the registers.  The interior is clean, a bit crowded at peak times, not too noisy with long picnic tables and benches or small tables for two. I ordered the ciabatta breakfast sandwich with a fried green tomato, a fried egg, pimiento cheese spread and home made sausage. It was a huge portion so I took half home.  It's really best to share since even my husbands sausage gravy over Biscuits was a very large portion.  The coffee was very good as was the medium pulpy orange juice.  My ciabatta sandwich was very good.  The crunchy fried green tomato made the sandwich almost perfect.  In the future I'd get the pimiento spread on the side.  It tends to overshadow the flavors of the other items.  My husband was very happy with his biscuits and sausage gravy.  It had a bit of peppery flavor and was creamy.  Those biscuits are really good but very heavy...true \"sinkers\" that fill you up fast.\nWe ordered some bakery items to take home with us.  The salted caramel dark chocolate mini pecan pie had a wonderful buttery crust.  But I warn you, the filling is so rich we each could only eat 1/4 of a mini sized pie.  We also ordered salted caramel chocolate brownie cakes. Huge round portions that turned you into a diabetic just looking at them.  They were moist and chocolatey and VERY dense but just too sweet! We each had 1 bite.  This restaurant is worth a visit.  Just be prepared to share share share!  You'll need lots of coffee to get past the heavy sweetness in the baked goods.</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Se7en Bites</td><td>2021-01-23</td><td>We decided to try Se7en Bites .
